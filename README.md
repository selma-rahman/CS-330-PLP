# C++ Tutorial 
This is a repo for learning C++ in CS330 Programming Languages at Simmons University

## History and Uses
C++ was officially released in 1985, created by Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist
working at AT&T Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey. Stroustrup wanted a language that built 
off the foundation of C but with more features such as different functions, better type checking, 
classes, etc. in order to support larger software development. 

C++ is a general purpose programming language, therefore itâ€™s has many uses and can be seen everywhere.
Some examples of programming use include: Game Development, Operating Systems, Embedded Systems, Browsers, Databases, and much more!

## Naming Conventions

## Data Types

## Control Statements
### Boolean Values
A boolean type is *bool*, which can take the values **true (1)** or **false(0)**. A boolean variable is declared with the *bool* keyword and can take the values *true* or *false*.

### Conditional Statements
#### *if* statement
The **if** statement is used to specify a block of code to be executed if a condition is true. Note that **if** is in lowercase, changing either or both letters to uppercase will produce an error.
```
if (some conditions)
  // statements
end
```
If the condition is true then do something, and if not then do something else.

#### *else* statement
The **else** statement is used to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.
```
if (condiition)
// execute if the condition is true
} else {
// execute if the condition is false
}
```
#### *else if* statement
The **else if** statemennt is used to specify a new condition if the initial condition is false.
```
if (condition1) {
// execute soem code if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {e
// execute some code if condition1 is false and condtion2 is true
} else {
// execute some code if condition1 and condition2 is fals
```

#### *switch* statement

## Code Delimiters

## Short-Circuit Evaluation

## Problems...
### dangling else problem...

## Loops
### While
### For
### etc

## Block Variables vs Function Variables
