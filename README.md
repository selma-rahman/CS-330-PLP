# C++ Tutorial 

## 1. What is the name of the language for this tutorial?
C++ (C plus plus)

## 2. History
C++ was officially released in 1985, created by Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist
working at AT&T Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey. Stroustrup wanted a language that built 
off the foundation of C but with more features such as different functions, better type checking, 
classes, etc. in order to support larger software development.
